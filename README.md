# Scientific_Calculator

## Description
This is a basic scientific calculator built using Java that features a plain command line version and a GUI version using Java Swing. 
The calculations themselves are done through the use of the [Shunting Yard Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm) to parse a given equation into a stack-based expression that follows PEMDAS (Reverse Polish Notation). This expression is then evaluated into the solution to the inputted equation.

## Instructions
``` ./calculator ``` Runs the scientific calculator in command line mode

``` ./calc_screen ``` Runs the scientific calculator using a GUI made from Java Swing
